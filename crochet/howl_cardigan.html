									<h5>Howl Pendragon's Cardigan (Howl's Moving Castle, movie adaptation by Studio Ghibli)</h5>
									<h6>I learned to crochet specially for this project! It was all leading up to this. </h6>
									<div class="scroll-container">
										
									</div> 
										<p>I am glad I practiced crochet with small projects because this was definitely my most difficult crochet project. I cannot count how many times I unraveled a section because I made a mistake or because I was unsatisfied with how it looked.<br>Because I am a noob and I did not do a test swatch beforehand, the back piece stretches sideways. Meanwhile, I had a hard time stretching the pieces length-wise to the given measurements in the pattern. Before assembling the parts, I blocked them to get them to the right measurements.<br>I am impressed with myself for being able to follow a written pattern and for finishing the entire thing! I don't want to touch yarn again anytime soon thought. <br><br>
										Pattern:<br>
										Pattern modifications: I crocheted the sleeves directly from the arm holes instead of starting from the cuffs because I wanted the sleeves to be more wide and "accurate" to the movie. This also allowed me to control the length of the sleeves and cuffs so they could fit me. I added a yellow trim at the hem of the cardigan because it made sense for my sewing brain (if the cuffs, the collar and the edges are hemmed with yellow, why not the bottom hem too?).<br>
										If I figure out a way to do it, I might add a red lining in the future for even more accuracy.<br><br>
										Materials:<br>
										3-4 skeins of <br>
										4.5 mm hook 
										safety pins<br><br>
										Towel, pins and weights or heavy objects (for wet-blocking)
										Start: 11-02-2023<br>
										Finish: 11-01-2025</p>
